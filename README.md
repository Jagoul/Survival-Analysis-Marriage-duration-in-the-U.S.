# Survival-Analysis-Marriage-duration-in-the-U.S.

This project investigates the factors affecting the marriage dissolution in the U.S. and analyzes covariates by the geographical region, education level, income, children, couple ethnicity and poverty percentage in each state. Provincial data from Princeton University  database has been used along with a part of the United States Census Bureau dataset on poverty, one of the largest ever databases covering all demographic information in the states. Using marital information of 3371 couples distributed in 4 different states to investigate marriage patterns among the richest states of New Hampshire and Maryland and compare it to the situation of couples in the poorest states in Alabama and Mississippi according to the poverty percentage. We describe and predict marriage survival time based on an interval of time between the years 1970 and 2016. A lot of observations have been made during the analysis of data, the influence of several covariates, especially education level and income have been given a special attention to understand their effects on marriage. In addition to these results, the paper presents an introduction to survival analysis methods, hazard function, cumulative hazard and regression models and their corresponding implementation in Python using Lifelines package. 

Women ages at marriage has been omitted in our study due to the lack of information on women participating in this survey, only husband ethnicity and education was taken into consideration which create one of the limitations. The study showed that Educated husbands have higher chances of marriage dissolution than the illiterate ones. Results suggest that dissolution rates are quite higher in Alabama, Mississippi and few regions of Maryland.

In the U.S., marriage has always been seen as a dynamic social event. In the past several decades marriage system has experienced various changes as a result of prosperity,socioeconomic development, improvement in education, dramatic increase in age at marriage of both the sexes, changes on attitude towards marriage, love-marriages,same-sex marriages, divorce and separation has been observed.
